## Welcome

Hello, my name is Alexandre Marques.

I'm ~~Portuguese~~ American. I am currently living in the **UK**, so classes in PT are all in the _evening and night_.

I'm sorry, I'm doing this very late. So here is my quote, by some other procrastinator:
> I leave all my assignments until last minute because diamonds are made under pressure.

For coding, I don't know much of the languages asked on the form but I'll learn them. Here is a begining:
`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        "Hello, World!"
    </head>
    <body>
        "Hello, World!"
    </body>
</html>`
The languages I'm more confident in are Java and C++, and I also know some python.
I enjoyed CSE 140L, making the modules was interesting. However, I didn't like CSE 30 as much, however this may have been on me.
As mentioned in the README.md of lab1 I like Processing. My uncle taught me and we made some small and wacky games in it.

This task makes me remember of a [http://alexandredegr8.unblog.fr/](blog) I had to create for my highschool French class.

I haven't made any new sections. I'll make some new ones to [here](# TODO) .
But I understand [something.md](relative links).

#### Hobbies
Here are some things I enjoy:
- Gaming (mostly fps or strategy)
- Reading (sci-fi or fantasy, also now webtoons/manga)
- Music
- Board games (but my family rarely plays them)
- Finding tiny mistakes in things and solving puzzles

#### Current classes
For this Quarter the classes in order of my liking will likely be:
1. CSE 110
2. CSE 101
3. ECE 109
4. PHIL 27

#### TODO
